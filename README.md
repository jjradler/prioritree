# prioritree
### A Priority and Task Management Tool
##### Prioritree helps you manage your to-do list!
By allowing you to input priority codes, first for goals, then supporting objectives,
then finally tasks within those objectives, Prioritree will generate your to-do
list each time you use it.

Additionally, the software limits the number of "high priority" codes to cause
you to make more critical choices about what is most important to accomplish at
any given time. Further, you can (and should) add links between tasks to show
their interdependencies as well as due-dates/times for the goals, objectives, and
tasks.

In order to help you focus on one objective (rather than a traditional brain-dump)
Prioritree forces you to focus on filling in the objectives for one goal, then
the supporting tasks and dependencies before moving on to another goal.

Once you have finished entering your goals, objectives, and tasks, Prioritree
calculates the overall prioritry for all tasks entered and generates a sorted
To-Do List for the instance you are using the program. Each task can be checked off
to allow you to track your progress, and once you do so, the algorithm will
recalculate the most important tasks for you to take care of at that instant.

Further, tasks may be grouped by Goal or Objective in _sub-trees_ to form
other, more focuesed lists should you be in the mood to tackle one of your other
goals, giving the user a bit more flexibility to choose and consider their
optimal workflow.

As well as the text-based "To Do Lists", this software will also generate
tree-diagrams incorporating customizable color-codes for important tasks,
urgent tasks, and dependency links. These trees will also be _prunable_ if a more
graphical interface is more to your taste rather than a text to-do list.
